# WOFLANG 2 Design Notes

## Philosophy

WOFLANG is a symbolic, stack-based interpreter inspired by the beauty of Unicode, glyphs, and the philosophy of language as magic. Every op, plugin, and sacred command is placed with intention, balance, and hidden purpose.

## Design Intent

- **Core**: All standard, sacred, meta, and "ritual/unlocked" ops.
- **Plugins**: Modular alternate sets (math, logic, chemistry, quantum, kanji, music, learning).
- **SIMD**: Fastest possible Unicode parsing for glyph-heavy syntax.
- **REPL**: Rituals, hidden commands, auto-completion, "prophecy" and joy eggs.

## Key Rituals

- "Egg" appears after 23 ops.
- `glyph_prophecy` only on full moon.
- Forbidden/void ops are hidden but always present.
- All plugin sets are drop-in, no recompilation needed.

See `sacred_ops_manifest.md` for ops list and meaning.
