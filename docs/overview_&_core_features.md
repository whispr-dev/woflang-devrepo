WofLang Language Overview & Core Features
Language Structure
WofLang combines unique syntactic elements with powerful computational capabilities through a layered architecture:
Syntax Elements
Core Operators

Mathematical: 齊 (add), 隶 (subtract), 丶 (multiply), 丿 (divide)
Logical: 而 (AND), 或 (OR), ⊕ (XOR), 无 (NOT)
Compound Logical: 无‍而 (NAND), 无‍或 (NOR)
Control Flow: 若 (if), 则 (then), 另 (else), 老 (while), 至 (for)
Assignment: 門 (gate - assigns values)
Comparison: 大 (>), 小 (<), 卜 (==), 丨 (!=), 走 (>=), 夊 (<=)

Data Types

Numeric: Analog values ranging from -100 to +100
String: Text data with Unicode support
Complex: Complex numbers for advanced mathematical operations
Structured: Custom data structures and objects

Special Commands

I/O: 出 (output), ⽰ (input), ⺙ (print), 響 (echo)
System: ⺆ (system call), 卩 (exit), 眠 (sleep)
Network: ⺒ (HTTP), ⺨ (proxy), 艮 (net)

Execution Model
WofLang employs a hybrid execution model that combines:

Register-Based Computation: Uses virtual registers (R0-R15) to store operational data
Stack-Based Evaluation: Maintains execution context through stack frames
Analog Signal Processing: Treats values as continuous signals rather than discrete data

Memory Management

Dynamic Allocation: Supports automatic and manual memory allocation
Garbage Collection: Implements mark-and-sweep for automatic memory reclamation
Direct Manipulation: Allows low-level memory operations for performance-critical code
Memory Mapping: Supports memory-mapped operations for specialized functionality

Thread creation and management primitives
Synchronization mechanisms (mutexes, semaphores)
Thread-safe data access

Pattern Matching

Complex conditional evaluation
Structure-based pattern recognition
Type-based dispatching

Error Handling

Line number reporting for precise error location
Error type classification system
Recovery mechanisms for non-fatal errors

Advanced Language Features

Parameter-based dispatch
Type-aware function selection

Regular Expression Support

Pattern-based string operations
Powerful text extraction and manipulation
Unicode-aware regex processing

Self-Modifying Code

Dynamic code generation capabilities
Runtime optimization through code adaptation
Context-sensitive behavior modification

Plugin System
WofLang implements a modular architecture allowing specialized functionality through plugins:

Mathematical Extensions: Advanced mathematical operations and algorithms
Domain-Specific Modules: Specialized functionality for fields like music and chemistry
Learning & Adaptation: Features for machine learning and adaptive systems
Logical Processing: Advanced boolean and symbolic logic operations

Implementation Details
The interpreter is structured around these key components:

Lexer/Parser: Converts WofLang code into an intermediate representation
Execution Engine: Processes the intermediate representation with analog signal semantics
Memory Manager: Handles allocation, tracking, and deallocation of resources
Plugin Manager: Loads and integrates extension modules
I/O System: Manages input/output operations and device interactions
Error Handler: Detects, reports, and recovers from error conditions

The v4.0.0 implementation focuses on performance optimization, stability, and extensibility while maintaining the unique character and philosophical underpinnings of the language.
