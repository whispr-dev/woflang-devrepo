WofLang Plugin Architecture & Extensions
Core Architecture
WofLang uses a modular architecture where core functionality can be extended through plugins. This approach allows for specialized capabilities to be loaded on demand, keeping the base language lean while enabling powerful domain-specific features.
Plugin System Design
Component Structure

Plugin Interface: Standard API for all plugins to implement
Plugin Manager: Core system component that loads and manages plugins
Plugin Registry: Tracks loaded plugins and their capabilities
Dynamic Loading: Runtime loading/unloading of plugin modules

Loading Mechanism
cppclass PluginInterface {
public:
    virtual ~PluginInterface() = default;
    virtual bool initialize() = 0;
    virtual bool registerCommands(CommandSystem& cmdSystem) = 0;
    virtual std::string getPluginName() const = 0;
};
Integration Points
Plugins can extend WofLang through multiple integration points:

Command Registration: Adding new operators and functions
Type Extensions: Introducing new data types
Interpreter Hooks: Intercepting and modifying interpreter behavior
I/O Extensions: Enhanced input/output capabilities

Plugin Development
Lifecycle Management

Initialization: Plugin sets up required resources
Registration: Plugin registers commands and extensions with the core system
Operation: Plugin responds to command invocations
Shutdown: Plugin releases resources

Resource Management

Memory Isolation: Plugins operate in their own memory space
Resource Tracking: System monitors resources allocated by plugins
Error Containment: Plugin errors are contained to prevent system crashes

Threading Model

Thread Safety: Plugins must implement thread-safe operations
Concurrent Access: Multiple threads may access plugin functionality
Synchronization: System provides synchronization primitives for plugins
