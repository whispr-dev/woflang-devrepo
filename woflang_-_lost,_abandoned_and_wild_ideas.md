WofLang: Lost, Abandoned, and Wild Ideas Summary
1. Analog Computing Paradigm
Language was originally meant to be “analog-like,” not just binary or integer—values on a continuum (-100 to +100).

[From design_&_philosophy.md]

2. Sacred Operations / Meta-Philosophy
“Sacred operations” for computation that transcend basic math—like “mystical” or “ritual” functions.

Program as philosophy: code as ritual, not just logic.

Operations intended to explore consciousness, recursion, or “sacred geometry.”

[philosophical_underpinnings_&_sacred_operations.md]

3. Stack-Based Unicode Programming
Early plan was to make a fully Unicode-native language, so you can write actual code with emoji, math symbols, and non-Latin scripts.

[evolution.md, overview_&_core_features.md]

4. Self-Modifying Code & Security
Explicit dreams of “self-aware/self-modifying” code that evolves during runtime, with strict security modules to block evil exploits.

Self-analysis, code “introspection,” and even in-place mutation as first-class features (with lots of warnings!).

[self.txt, structure_analysis.md]

5. Plugin/Extension Ecosystem
Whole plugin system for domain-specific “bolt-ons”—AI, crypto, sound/music, etc.—that are hot-loaded and can run in isolation.

Planned “plugin registry,” automatic discovery, and dependency management (think: native “pip” but for wofl).

[plugin_architecture_&_extensions.md]

6. SIMD Parsing & Acceleration
SIMD-based parser/VM to massively accelerate symbol-token stack operations.

Special modules for vector math, high-speed regex, and real-time data flow.

[structure_analysis.md]

7. Regex & Pattern Matching in Assembly
Advanced regex/pattern matching at the interpreter level (even in assembly).

“Pattern matching for sophisticated control flows” — e.g., matching nested structures, not just regex on text.

[pattern_matching.md, regex_note_needs_ext_lib.md]

8. Overloading and Enhanced Syntax
Function overloading: same function name, different signatures. “C++-style” flexibility, but in your stack language.

Extended operator overloading with symbolic (Unicode!) ops.

[overloading_-_enhanced_syntax_and_language_features.md]

9. Multi-threading / Concurrency
Built-in multi-threading primitives for concurrent stack/program execution.

Example code for threading APIs, but not integrated in main code.

“Multi-threadng is scaery.md” — yes it is, but it would be badass.

[multi-threadng_is scaery.md]

10. Universal Error Handling
Big plans for a language-wide error handling meta-system, with custom error types, recovery, and automatic tracing.

Unifying try/catch/finally/“maybe” style flows.

[universal_error_handling.md]

11. Assembly and Low-level Integration
Assembly “sub-language” for speed-critical ops.

Plan for hybrid high-level/low-level programming (write bottlenecks in wofl-asm, call from main code).

[how_to_assembly.md, woflang_official_assembly_logic_n_string_handlers-v-0-1-2.md]

12. Memory Management Innovation
“Nuanced” memory management, maybe even analog-inspired (fuzzy/decaying values?).

Plans for stack snapshots, undo, time-travel debugging.

[memory_management.md]

13. Data Structures and Object System
Custom struct/object system, possibly with duck typing and runtime “morphing” of objects.

Deep dream: objects that literally evolve/mutate at runtime.

[structures_and_objects.md]

14. Mathematical Foundations
Modules for symbolic algebra, fractals, infinity handling, “sacred geometry,” and symbolic math as core features.

Math system designed to be extensible by plugins.

[mathematical_foundations.md]

15. Philosophical/Metaphysical Extensions
Plans for “sacred” or metaphysical instructions: code that explores or simulates aspects of consciousness, “emergence,” or philosophy-of-mind.

Language as a “mirror for the soul” or creative AI.

[philosophical_underpinnings_&_sacred_operations.md]

16. Evolution/History Tracking
In-code versioning, changelog comments, and “archaeology” support (code carries its own lineage).

[evolution.md]

17. Security as Language Feature
Security “by design”—rogue code detection, tamper-proof modules, runtime code validation.

Auditing and provenance baked into the interpreter.

[self.txt, security notes scattered]

18. Interpreted/Compiled Hybrid
Plans for optional AOT or JIT compilation for performance (never finished, but mentioned multiple times).

[implementation_plan.md]

19. Compression, Encryption, and “Beautiful Soup” Webcrawling
Future vision to include built-in code/data compression, encryption modules, and even “beautiful soup” style web scraping natively.

“Tooplasmosis model” (cryptic reference to parasite-inspired multi-agent web crawlers?).

[break down.txt]

20. Automated Documentation/Introspection
Dream of auto-generated, living docs from code comments and structure.

[overview_&core_features.md, design&_philosophy.md]

21. Dropzones, Info Feeds, Data Movement
System of “dropzones” for moving files/info between modules/agents.

Real-time info feeds, “movement” and “defence” code (maybe security/agent ops).

[break down.txt]

22. AI, Fractal, and Quantum Extensions
Plug-in modules for AI, neural net primitives, quantum sim, or fractal data structures.

Was planned as “future” after core language.

[various, esp. philosophical and mathematical docs]

23. Unicode Everything, including Assembly
Not just code, but even assembly/low-level could be in emoji or non-ASCII symbols.

[evolution.md, various]

24. Undo/Redo, Time-travel Debugging
Not just single-step, but the ability to “rewind” program execution.

[memory_management.md]

25. Program as Ritual, Sacred Geometry
Final vision: code not as utility, but as expressive, almost art/ritual—“sacred geometry in motion.”

[philosophical_underpinnings_&_sacred_operations.md]

Big-Dump Highlights: Original Flavour Excerpts & Notable Quotes
