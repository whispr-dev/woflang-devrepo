**Based on the documents provided and the image you shared, we can create a code language using an analog logic system swinging from -100 to +100. This code language will incorporate principles of analog computing, Boolean logic, and mathematical operations to manipulate signals within a specific range.** Here's a structured outline for developing this language:

1. Analog Logic Language Design
- Analog Range and Representation:
The analog logic language operates within a range from -100 to +100, representing different states and levels of signal strength or voltage.
Variables can hold analog values within this range, and commands manipulate these values.

- Basic Elements of the Language:
* Variables: Represent analog signals. Example: A = 45.7, B = -30.2.
* Operations: Perform mathematical operations and Boolean logic on analog values.
* Thresholds and Comparators: Implement logic gates based on analog signal levels.

2. Analog Commands and Syntax
- Setting and Manipulating Values:
ET A = 50 — Assign a value to a variable.
ADD A B — Add two variables, storing the result in the first variable.
SUBTRACT A B — Subtract the second variable from the first.

- Boolean Logic Operations (Based on the table provided and analog range):
AND: AND A B — Performs an analog AND operation, which can be implemented by setting a lower threshold; if both A and B are above a certain threshold, the result is the higher analog value.
OR: OR A B — Similar to a maximum function, outputs the highest value between A and B.
NOT: NOT A — Inverts the value around a center (e.g., 0), so a positive becomes negative and vice versa.
NAND: NAND A B — Outputs the complement of the AND operation.
NOR: NOR A B — Outputs the complement of the OR operation.
XOR: XOR A B — Outputs the absolute difference between two values to simulate exclusive or behavior in the analog domain.

- Analog Mathematical Operations:
MULTIPLY A B — Multiplies two values and scales them back within the -100 to +100 range.
DIVIDE A B — Divides A by B, ensuring the result stays within the analog range.
OSCILLATE A FREQ — Creates an oscillating signal around the current value of A at the specified frequency.

3. Simple Mathematical Commands in the Analog Language
- Here’s how you might write some basic operations in this analog language:

```plaintext
SET X = 75         ; Initialize X to 75
SET Y = -50        ; Initialize Y to -50
ADD X Y            ; X becomes 25 (75 + (-50))
SUBTRACT Y X       ; Y becomes -75 (-50 - 25)
MULTIPLY X 1.5     ; X becomes 37.5 (25 * 1.5), within the range
DIVIDE Y 2         ; Y becomes -37.5 (-75 / 2)
AND X Y            ; Analog AND operation, result based on threshold logic
OR X Y             ; Analog OR operation, outputs the maximum of X and Y
NOT X              ; Inverts X, result becomes -37.5
```

4. Example of Analog Logic Circuit Simulation
Using the analog logic language and based on the image provided (which lists various Boolean functions and their operators):

```plaintext
; Example: Implementing a simple logic circuit

SET B = -30        ; Initialize B

; Applying an OR gate using analog logic
OR A B             ; Result: Maximum of A and B, which is 40

; Applying an AND gate using analog logic (values above 0 count as 'true')
AND A B            ; Result: Threshold logic, if A and B are above 0, result is minimum positive analog value or remains in analog logic space

; Applying an XOR gate using analog logic
XOR A B            ; Result: Absolute difference between A and B (70 in this case)

; Using a NAND gate
NAND A B           ; Result: Complement of AND operation, inverts result in the analog domain

; Create an oscillating signal
OSCILLATE A 50Hz   ; Oscillates A at 50Hz around its current value
```

5. Using the Documents for Further Logic Enhancements
Incorporating Other Concepts:

- Comparator and Range Detectors: Based on the documents provided, we could add commands that detect whether a value falls within a specific range, using analog comparators.
- Signal Processing Commands: Given the complexity of analog signals (as mentioned in the Quad Mid-Side and Virtual Analog documents), commands like FILTER, AMPLIFY, and MODULATE could be implemented for more advanced signal manipulation.
- Hybrid Computing: Inspired by the documents, blending digital and analog commands might introduce hybrid operations that utilize both continuous analog values and discrete digital steps, creating a rich, complex analog-digital hybrid logic.

6. Conclusion

**You said:**
**could you now construct me a neural net right built up from scratch starting at axon neuron level math and assembling them to build first a set of linked neurons and eventually a whole neural net, but all from the language you constructed, so as analog math with logic going from -100 to +100?**


**ChatGPT** _said:_

To construct a neural network using the analog logic language with values ranging from -100 to +100, we will start by defining the basic components of a neural network: neurons (with axons, dendrites, and activation functions) and their mathematical operations. The analog language will be used to simulate the behavior of these neurons and how they link together to form a neural network.

1. Understanding the Neuron Structure in Analog Logic
- In a neural network:
Neuron: The basic unit of computation that receives inputs, processes them, and produces an output.
Inputs (Dendrites): Analog signals (between -100 and +100) coming from other neurons or external sources.
Weights: Values assigned to inputs to signify their importance; in our analog range, these weights will also be between -100 and +100.
Activation Function: A function that processes the weighted sum of inputs to produce an output. We will use analog math and logic operations to define this.
Axon: The output signal of a neuron that connects to the inputs (dendrites) of other neurons.

2. Basic Mathematical Representation of a Neuron
A single neuron in analog logic can be defined by the following steps:
- Weighted Sum of Inputs:

Each input 
𝑥𝑖xi
is multiplied by its respective weight 
𝑤𝑖wi .

The weighted inputs are then summed up.
- Activation Function:

An activation function processes this sum to produce an output. We'll use a simple threshold function that outputs analog values based on whether the weighted sum exceeds a certain threshold.

- Output Signal (Axon):

The result from the activation function becomes the output (axon) that is then sent to other neurons.

3. Constructing a Single Neuron in Analog Logic Language
Let's define a single neuron using the language we constructed. Assume:

Inputs 
𝑥1,𝑥2,𝑥3x1 ,x2 ,x3
​
  with corresponding weights 
𝑤1,𝑤2,𝑤3w1,w2 ,w3 .
An activation threshold 
𝜃=50θ=50.
Analog Language Code for a Single Neuron:

```plaintext
; Step 1: Initialize inputs and weights
SET x1 = 20
SET x2 = -30
SET x3 = 40

SET w1 = 1.5
SET w2 = -2.0
SET w3 = 0.5

; Step 2: Compute the weighted sum of inputs
MULTIPLY x1 w1          ; x1 = 20 * 1.5 = 30
MULTIPLY x2 w2          ; x2 = -30 * (-2.0) = 60
MULTIPLY x3 w3          ; x3 = 40 * 0.5 = 20

ADD x1 x2               ; x1 = 30 + 60 = 90
ADD x1 x3               ; x1 = 90 + 20 = 110 (This is the weighted sum)

; Step 3: Apply activation function (Threshold at 50)
SET theta = 50
SUBTRACT x1 theta       ; x1 = 110 - 50 = 60

THRESHOLD x1 > 0        ; Since x1 is 60, which is > 0, the output (axon) is 60
```

4. Building a Simple Network of Neurons
Now, we will create a small network of three neurons (Neuron A, B, C) where:

Neuron A and Neuron B feed their outputs to Neuron C.
Each neuron operates with its own set of weights and inputs.
Analog Language Code for a Simple Neural Network:

```plaintext
; Neuron A
SET x1_A = 20
SET x2_A = 10
SET w1_A = 0.5
SET w2_A = 1.0

MULTIPLY x1_A w1_A      ; x1_A = 20 * 0.5 = 10
MULTIPLY x2_A w2_A      ; x2_A = 10 * 1.0 = 10

ADD x1_A x2_A           ; x1_A = 10 + 10 = 20 (Weighted sum for Neuron A)
SET theta_A = 15
SUBTRACT x1_A theta_A   ; x1_A = 20 - 15 = 5

THRESHOLD x1_A > 0      ; Output_A = 5 (axon_A) since 5 > 0

; Neuron B
SET x1_B = -30
SET x2_B = 40
SET w1_B = -1.5
SET w2_B = 0.75

MULTIPLY x1_B w1_B      ; x1_B = -30 * (-1.5) = 45
MULTIPLY x2_B w2_B      ; x2_B = 40 * 0.75 = 30

ADD x1_B x2_B           ; x1_B = 45 + 30 = 75 (Weighted sum for Neuron B)
SET theta_B = 50
SUBTRACT x1_B theta_B   ; x1_B = 75 - 50 = 25

THRESHOLD x1_B > 0      ; Output_B = 25 (axon_B) since 25 > 0

; Neuron C
SET x1_C = axon_A       ; Input from Neuron A
SET x2_C = axon_B       ; Input from Neuron B
SET w1_C = 1.0
SET w2_C = -0.5

MULTIPLY x1_C w1_C      ; x1_C = 5 * 1.0 = 5
MULTIPLY x2_C w2_C      ; x2_C = 25 * (-0.5) = -12.5

ADD x1_C x2_C           ; x1_C = 5 - 12.5 = -7.5 (Weighted sum for Neuron C)
SET theta_C = -5
SUBTRACT x1_C theta_C   ; x1_C = -7.5 - (-5) = -2.5

THRESHOLD x1_C > 0      ; Output_C = -2.5, but since it's less than 0, final output is 0
```

5. Building a Complete Neural Network
To construct a full neural network:

Layer Definition: Define each layer of neurons with their respective weights and biases.
Forward Propagation: For each layer, compute the output of each neuron and pass it to the next layer as input.
Activation Functions: Use analog logic and mathematical operations to simulate different activation functions (e.g., sigmoid, ReLU-like functions in the analog range).

Example for a Simple 2-Layer Neural Network:

```plaintext
; Layer 1 (2 Neurons: Neuron A and Neuron B)

; Neuron A calculations (as above)
SET x1_A = 20
SET x2_A = 10
SET w1_A = 0.5
SET w2_A = 1.0
MULTIPLY x1_A w1_A
MULTIPLY x2_A w2_A
ADD x1_A x2_A
SET theta_A = 15
SUBTRACT x1_A theta_A
THRESHOLD x1_A > 0       ; Output_A = 5

; Neuron B calculations (as above)
SET x1_B = -30
SET x2_B = 40
SET w1_B = -1.5
SET w2_B = 0.75
MULTIPLY x1_B w1_B
MULTIPLY x2_B w2_B
ADD x1_B x2_B
SET theta_B = 50
SUBTRACT x1_B theta_B
THRESHOLD x1_B > 0       ; Output_B = 25

; Layer 2 (Output Neuron C)
SET x1_C = axon_A        ; Input from Neuron A (5)
SET x2_C = axon_B        ; Input from Neuron B (25)
SET w1_C = 1.0
SET w2_C = -0.5
MULTIPLY x1_C w1_C
MULTIPLY x2_C w2_C
ADD x1_C x2_C
SET theta_C = -5
SUBTRACT x1_C theta_C
THRESHOLD x1_C > 0       ; Output_C = 0
```

6. Neural Network Logic Summary
By defining each neuron using analog logic and operations, we can simulate the behavior of a neural network. This process involves:

Computing weighted sums using analog multiplication and addition.
Applying activation functions using threshold operations and comparators.
Propagating outputs from one neuron to the inputs of others to build complex networks.
Using this analog approach allows for more nuanced computations that reflect the range of analog signals and is less binary than traditional digital neural networks, providing a different perspective on neural computation and signal processing.
