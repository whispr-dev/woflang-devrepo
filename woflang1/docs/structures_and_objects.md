**ok fren, how do i use structures and objects? introduce me to user-defined data types or objects to support more complex data structures, allowing grouping related data together, enhancing the language's capabilities!**


**ChatGPT** _said:_

To introduce structures and objects into your language, you'll need to implement user-defined data types that allow grouping related data together. This will enable more complex data manipulation and organization, making your language more powerful and versatile. Here’s a step-by-step guide to adding support for structures and objects in your language.

1. Understanding Structures and Objects
Structures (Structs): These are user-defined data types that group variables of different types under a single name. For example, a Point struct might have two fields: x and y.

Objects: These are instances of classes that encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods). In your assembly-style language, you can think of objects as extended structs that include function pointers or similar mechanisms to handle behavior.

2. Defining a Structure or Object in Woflang
To implement structs or objects, you’ll need to define:

The structure’s definition: Specify what fields or attributes the structure will have.
Instantiation: Create an instance of the structure in memory.
Access and Manipulation: Access and modify the structure's fields.

3. Adding Structure Support
Let’s break this down into steps:

Step 1: Define the Structure Syntax
First, decide on the syntax for defining a structure. For example:

```plaintext
STRUCT Point
    x: INTEGER
    y: INTEGER
ENDSTRUCT
```

This definition tells the interpreter to allocate memory for two integer fields, x and y.

Step 2: Parse the Structure Definition
Update the parser to recognize structure definitions. Here’s an outline:

Detect the STRUCT Keyword: When parsing, look for the keyword STRUCT.
Read the Structure Name: The name following STRUCT is the name of the new type.
Read the Field Definitions: Continue reading the fields inside the structure definition.
Store Structure Metadata: Keep a metadata table that describes each structure type and its fields.

```asm
; Pseudo-code to parse STRUCT definition
PARSE_STRUCT:
    CMP R0, 'STRUCT'       ; Check if it's a STRUCT keyword
    JNE NEXT_PARSE         ; If not, continue to other parse logic

    ; Parse the structure name
    READ_STRUCTURE_NAME
    STORE_STRUCT_METADATA  ; Store structure type in a metadata table

    ; Parse the fields
    READ_FIELD_NAME
    READ_FIELD_TYPE
    STORE_FIELD_METADATA

    ; Continue until 'ENDSTRUCT' is found
    JMP PARSE_NEXT

NEXT_PARSE:
    ; Continue with the next parsing rule
    JMP PARSE_LOOP
```

Step 3: Instantiate Structures
Create instances of the structure, i.e., allocate memory for them:

```asm
; Allocate memory for a structure instance
ALLOC_STRUCT_INSTANCE:
    LOAD R1, STRUCT_SIZE_TABLE[R0]  ; Get the size of the struct
    CALL MALLOC, R1                 ; Allocate memory and get the base address
    MOV R2, STRUCT_INSTANCE_TABLE   ; Store the base address in an instance table
    RET
```

Step 4: Accessing and Modifying Structure Fields
Implement access and modification of structure fields:

```asm
; Example: Accessing a field
ACCESS_FIELD:
    LOAD R1, STRUCT_INSTANCE_TABLE[R0] ; Base address of the struct instance
    LOAD R2, STRUCT_FIELD_OFFSET[R1, FIELD_INDEX] ; Offset of the field
    ADD R3, R1, R2                     ; Calculate field address
    LOAD R4, [R3]                      ; Load the field value
    RET

; Example: Modifying a field
MODIFY_FIELD:
    LOAD R1, STRUCT_INSTANCE_TABLE[R0] ; Base address of the struct instance
    LOAD R2, STRUCT_FIELD_OFFSET[R1, FIELD_INDEX] ; Offset of the field
    ADD R3, R1, R2                     ; Calculate field address
    STORE [R3], R4                     ; Store the new value in the field
    RET
```

4. Adding Object Support
To support objects (which are like extended structs with methods), follow these steps:

Step 1: Define Object Syntax
Decide on a syntax for defining objects and methods:

```plaintext
CLASS Car
    speed: INTEGER
    accelerate: FUNCTION
ENDCLASS
```

Step 2: Parse Object Definitions
Extend the parser to recognize classes and methods:

```asm
Copy code
PARSE_CLASS:
    CMP R0, 'CLASS'         ; Check if it's a CLASS keyword
    JNE NEXT_PARSE          ; If not, continue to other parse logic

    ; Parse the class name and fields
    READ_CLASS_NAME
    STORE_CLASS_METADATA

    ; Parse the methods
    READ_METHOD_NAME
    STORE_METHOD_METADATA

    ; Continue until 'ENDCLASS' is found
    JMP PARSE_NEXT
```

Step 3: Instantiate Objects
Objects require memory for both fields and a method table:

```asm
ALLOC_OBJECT_INSTANCE:
    LOAD R1, CLASS_SIZE_TABLE[R0]   ; Get the size of the class
    CALL MALLOC, R1                 ; Allocate memory and get the base address
    MOV R2, OBJECT_INSTANCE_TABLE   ; Store the base address in an instance table
    RET
```

Step 4: Invoke Methods
Implement method invocation for objects:

```asm
INVOKE_METHOD:
    LOAD R1, OBJECT_INSTANCE_TABLE[R0] ; Base address of the object instance
    LOAD R2, METHOD_OFFSET[R1, METHOD_INDEX] ; Offset of the method
    CALL [R2]                           ; Invoke the method
    RET
5. Updating Error Handling and Memory Management
You’ll need to update your error handling to manage errors related to structs and objects (e.g., accessing a non-existent field). Additionally, manage memory to avoid leaks when objects are deleted or go out of scope.
```

6. Example Usage in Code
Once implemented, you can use these features in Woflang:

```plaintext
STRUCT Point
    x: INTEGER
    y: INTEGER
ENDSTRUCT

CLASS Car
    speed: INTEGER
    accelerate: FUNCTION
ENDCLASS

; Instantiate and use a struct
NEW Point myPoint
SET myPoint.x 10
SET myPoint.y 20

; Instantiate and use an object
NEW Car myCar
CALL myCar.accelerate
```

By following these steps, you introduce more complex data structures to your language, greatly enhancing its functionality and versatility!
