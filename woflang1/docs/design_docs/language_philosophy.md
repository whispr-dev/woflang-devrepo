# WOFLANG: Language of Glyphs and Intuition

WOFLANG is not just a programming language — it is a symbolic operating system for thought.

- Code must be visual.
- Function structure must feel like a block.
- Every instruction is a glyph. Every glyph, a memory.
- Syntax should be interpretable by human intuition and machine precision alike.
- It is not meant to replace conventional languages — it is here to outlive them.

WOFLANG is an expression-first, block-structured, symbol-powered runtime where clarity and compression coexist.
