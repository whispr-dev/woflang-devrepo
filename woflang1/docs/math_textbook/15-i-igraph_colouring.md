hey fren can you fill in then placeholders with actual C++ code in this to perform the appropriately?
C++
                //      Graph Coloring: Functions for coloring graphs with minimal colors
            void calc(const std::<double>& in, std::<std::complex<double>>& out) {
        plex* in_calc = reinterpret_cast<calc_complex*>(calc_malloc(sizeof(calc_complex) * in.size()));
        plex* out_calc = reinterpret_cast<calc_complex*>(calc_malloc(sizeof(calc_complex) * in.size()));

Let's fill in the placeholder code for Graph Coloring in C++. Graph coloring is an algorithmic problem of assigning colors to the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. The goal is to use the minimal number of colors.

Objective
We will implement a C++ function to:

Graph Coloring: Use a greedy algorithm to color a graph with the minimal number of colors. This algorithm is simple and efficient for many use cases.
C++ Code for Graph Coloring
Hereâ€™s the complete C++ implementation to replace your placeholders for graph coloring:

cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

// Function to perform greedy graph coloring
std::vector<int> greedyGraphColoring(const std::vector<std::vector<int>>& graph) {
    int n = graph.size();  // Number of vertices
    std::vector<int> result(n, -1);  // Store color of each vertex
    std::vector<bool> availableColors(n, false);  // Track available colors for vertices

    // Assign the first color to the first vertex
    result[0] = 0;

    // Assign colors to the remaining vertices
    for (int u = 1; u < n; u++) {
        // Mark colors of adjacent vertices as unavailable
        for (int i : graph[u]) {
            if (result[i] != -1) {
                availableColors[result[i]] = true;
            }
        }

        // Find the first available color
        int color;
        for (color = 0; color < n; color++) {
            if (!availableColors[color]) {
                break;
            }
        }

        result[u] = color;  // Assign the found color

        // Reset the available colors for the next iteration
        for (int i : graph[u]) {
            if (result[i] != -1) {
                availableColors[result[i]] = false;
            }
        }
    }

    return result;
}

// General function to perform graph coloring
void calc(const std::vector<std::vector<int>>& graph, std::vector<int>& coloringResult) {
    // Perform graph coloring
    coloringResult = greedyGraphColoring(graph);
    std::cout << "Graph Coloring (vertex colors): ";
    for (int color : coloringResult) {
        std::cout << color << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
}

// Example usage function
int main() {
    // Example graph represented as an adjacency list
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> graph = {
        {1, 2},     // Vertex 0 is connected to vertices 1 and 2
        {0, 2, 3},  // Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 0, 2, and 3
        {0, 1, 3},  // Vertex 2 is connected to vertices 0, 1, and 3
        {1, 2, 4},  // Vertex 3 is connected to vertices 1, 2, and 4
        {3}         // Vertex 4 is connected to vertex 3
    };

    std::vector<int> coloringResult;

    // Perform graph coloring
    calc(graph, coloringResult);

    return 0;
}
Explanation of the Code
Graph Representation:

The graph is represented as an adjacency list (std::vector<std::vector<int>>). Each entry in the list represents a vertex and contains a vector of vertices that are adjacent to it.
Greedy Graph Coloring Algorithm:

greedyGraphColoring: Uses a greedy algorithm to assign colors to each vertex of the graph.
Algorithm Details:
Initialization: Assigns the first color (0) to the first vertex.
Color Assignment:
For each vertex u, it marks the colors of all adjacent vertices as unavailable.
Finds the first available color and assigns it to vertex u.
Resets the available colors for the next vertex.
The algorithm guarantees that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.
General Function (calc):

Takes the graph as input and performs the greedy graph coloring algorithm.
Stores the result in coloringResult and prints the color assigned to each vertex.
Main Function (main):

Sets up an example graph with five vertices and edges connecting them.
Calls calc to perform graph coloring and print the results.
Key Points
Greedy Graph Coloring: This simple and efficient algorithm assigns colors to graph vertices while ensuring no two adjacent vertices share the same color.
Modularity: The code is modular, allowing easy modification or replacement of the graph coloring algorithm with more sophisticated algorithms if needed.
Scalability: The greedy algorithm works well for small to medium-sized graphs but may not find the optimal coloring for larger or more complex graphs.
This C++ code provides a robust implementation for graph coloring, which is a fundamental problem in graph theory with applications in scheduling, register allocation in compilers, and more. You can expand it further by implementing more advanced graph coloring algorithms or optimizing for specific graph structures.
