Let's fill in the placeholder code for Modular Exponentiation in C++. Modular exponentiation is a mathematical operation that is crucial for many cryptographic algorithms, such as RSA. It involves computing large powers of numbers modulo a given number efficiently.

C++ Code for Modular Exponentiation
Here’s the complete C++ implementation to replace your placeholders for computing large powers modulo a number:

cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

// Function to perform modular exponentiation (base^exp % mod)
long long modularExponentiation(long long base, long long exp, long long mod) {
    long long result = 1;
    base = base % mod;  // Update base if it is more than or equal to mod

    while (exp > 0) {
        // If exp is odd, multiply base with result
        if (exp % 2 == 1) {
            result = (result * base) % mod;
        }

        // Now exp must be even, so we divide it by 2
        exp = exp >> 1;  // exp = exp / 2
        base = (base * base) % mod;  // Change base to base^2
    }

    return result;
}

// General function to perform modular exponentiation
void calc(long long base, long long exp, long long mod, long long& result) {
    // Perform modular exponentiation
    result = modularExponentiation(base, exp, mod);
    std::cout << "Modular Exponentiation (" << base << "^" << exp << " % " << mod << "): " << result << std::endl;
}

// Example usage function
int main() {
    long long base = 2;
    long long exp = 10;
    long long mod = 1000;
    long long result;

    // Compute modular exponentiation
    calc(base, exp, mod, result);

    return 0;
}

General Function (calc):

The calc function takes the base, exponent, and modulus as inputs and computes the modular exponentiation using the modularExponentiation function.
The result is stored in result, which is also printed to the console.
