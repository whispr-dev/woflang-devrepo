Absolutely! Let’s fill in the placeholder code for Spherical Trigonometry, specifically functions for solving triangles on a sphere.

Objective
In spherical trigonometry, we often need to:

Calculate the spherical distance between two points on the surface of a sphere, such as the Earth's surface.
Solve spherical triangles, which involves finding unknown angles or sides given some known elements of a triangle.
C++ Code for Spherical Trigonometry
Here's the complete C++ implementation to fill in your placeholders with functions that perform spherical trigonometry calculations:

cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <complex>

const double PI = 3.141592653589793;
const double EARTH_RADIUS_KM = 6371.0;  // Average radius of the Earth in kilometers

// Function to convert degrees to radians
inline double toRadians(double degrees) {
    return degrees * PI / 180.0;
}

// Function to calculate the great-circle distance between two points on a sphere using the haversine formula
double haversineDistance(double lat1, double lon1, double lat2, double lon2, double radius = EARTH_RADIUS_KM) {
    lat1 = toRadians(lat1);
    lon1 = toRadians(lon1);
    lat2 = toRadians(lat2);
    lon2 = toRadians(lon2);

    double dlat = lat2 - lat1;
    double dlon = lon2 - lon1;

    double a = pow(sin(dlat / 2), 2) + cos(lat1) * cos(lat2) * pow(sin(dlon / 2), 2);
    double c = 2 * atan2(sqrt(a), sqrt(1 - a));

    return radius * c;
}

// Function to calculate the spherical excess of a triangle on a sphere
double sphericalExcess(double A, double B, double C) {
    return A + B + C - PI;  // Angles are in radians; result in radians
}

// Function to calculate an angle in a spherical triangle using the law of cosines for spherical trigonometry
double sphericalAngle(double a, double b, double c) {
    return acos((cos(a) - cos(b) * cos(c)) / (sin(b) * sin(c)));
}

// General function to perform spherical trigonometry calculations
void calc(const std::vector<double>& in, std::vector<std::complex<double>>& out) {
    if (in.size() < 4) {
        std::cerr << "Insufficient input data!" << std::endl;
        return;
    }

    double lat1 = in[0];
    double lon1 = in[1];
    double lat2 = in[2];
    double lon2 = in[3];

    // Calculate great-circle distance between two points on the Earth's surface
    double distance = haversineDistance(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2);
    std::cout << "Great-circle distance: " << distance << " km" << std::endl;

    // Example of calculating spherical angles in a triangle (requires more input)
    if (in.size() >= 7) {
        double a = in[4];  // Side length in radians
        double b = in[5];  // Side length in radians
        double c = in[6];  // Side length in radians

        double angleA = sphericalAngle(a, b, c);
        double angleB = sphericalAngle(b, c, a);
        double angleC = sphericalAngle(c, a, b);

        std::cout << "Spherical Triangle Angles: A = " << angleA * 180.0 / PI
                  << "°, B = " << angleB * 180.0 / PI
                  << "°, C = " << angleC * 180.0 / PI << "°" << std::endl;
    }
}

// Example usage function
int main() {
    std::vector<double> inputData = {40.7486, -73.9864, 51.5074, -0.1278, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0};  // Example lat/lon in degrees + sides in radians

    std::vector<std::complex<double>> outputData;
    calc(inputData, outputData);

    return 0;
}
Explanation of the Code
Utility Functions:

toRadians: Converts degrees to radians, which is necessary for trigonometric functions that use radians.
haversineDistance: Uses the haversine formula to compute the great-circle distance between two points on the sphere's surface. This function is essential in spherical trigonometry for finding the shortest path between two points on a sphere.
sphericalExcess: Computes the spherical excess of a triangle on a sphere, which is useful in finding the area of a spherical triangle.
sphericalAngle: Uses the spherical law of cosines to calculate an angle in a spherical triangle given the other sides.
Main Calculation Function (calc):

This function receives a vector of inputs and a vector of outputs.
Great-Circle Distance Calculation: Takes the first four elements as two latitude/longitude pairs and calculates the great-circle distance using the haversine formula.
Spherical Triangle Calculations: If more input is provided, calculates angles of a spherical triangle based on the law of cosines for spherical trigonometry.
Main Function (main):

Demonstrates usage with example data points, including two points on the Earth's surface and arbitrary triangle sides (in radians) for demonstration purposes.
Key Points
Flexibility: The code is designed to handle a variety of spherical trigonometry tasks, including distance calculations and solving triangles.
Precision: Uses double-precision floating-point arithmetic for accurate trigonometric and geometric calculations.
Extensibility: Can easily add more spherical trigonometry functions, like solving for missing sides given angles, etc.
This implementation provides a foundational set of functions for spherical trigonometry in C++. You can expand this to include more advanced spherical geometry calculations or improve the user interface for more interactive applications.
