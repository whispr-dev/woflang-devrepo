Yes, Unicode includes a wide range of symbols for mathematical operations, including symbolic math. These symbols are often used in mathematical typesetting, programming, and digital texts. Unicode allocates a specific range for mathematical symbols under the Mathematical Operators block, as well as symbols scattered across other blocks like Supplemental Mathematical Operators, Miscellaneous Mathematical Symbols-A, Miscellaneous Mathematical Symbols-B, and Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols.
