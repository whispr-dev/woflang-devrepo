**welp, i guess we'll start at the beginning and make our wway into advancd error handling then - can you show me where are good places to put in reports of code locations via line number and error type reports please?**


**ChatGPT* _said:_

To implement advanced error handling with detailed reports of code locations (via line number) and error types, you need to strategically place error checking and reporting mechanisms throughout your interpreter. Here’s how to enhance your code to include comprehensive error reporting:

1. Initialization and Setup:
Line Number Tracking: Add a register (e.g., R94) to track the current line number being processed. Increment this register every time a new line is read.
Error Type Tracking: Define a set of error codes to identify different types of errors (e.g., ERR_SYNTAX, ERR_TYPE, ERR_RUNTIME).

2. Strategic Error Checking Points:
Header Validation: Check for the presence and correctness of the WFL_HEADER at the start of the program. Report an error if missing or incorrect.
Block Order Validation: Ensure that the program blocks (VAR, FUNC, MAIN, etc.) appear in the correct order. Report errors for incorrect order or missing blocks.
Command Parsing: Verify that each command is recognized. Report an error if an unrecognized command is encountered.
Data Type Checking: Ensure that operations are performed on compatible data types. Report errors for type mismatches.
Runtime Checks: Handle divide-by-zero and other runtime errors. Report runtime errors with detailed messages.

3. Implementation in Your Code:
Here’s how you can modify your existing assembly code to include advanced error handling:

```asm
; Initialize Registers and Memory
MOV R0, 0    ; Initialize R0 (General purpose register)
MOV R1, 0    ; Initialize R1 (General purpose register)
...
MOV R93, 0   ; Initialize R93 (General purpose register)
MOV R94, 1   ; Initialize R94 to track line numbers, starting at line 1
MOV R95, 0   ; Initialize R95 for storing error codes

; Error Codes
ERR_HEADER_MISSING EQU 0x01
ERR_BLOCK_ORDER    EQU 0x02
ERR_UNRECOGNIZED   EQU 0x03
ERR_TYPE_MISMATCH  EQU 0x04
ERR_RUNTIME        EQU 0x05

; Error Reporting Routine
REPORT_ERROR:
    ; Print error type and line number
    MOV R96, R95           ; Load error code into R96 for display
    MOV R97, R94           ; Load current line number into R97 for display
    ; Use appropriate system calls or routines to display error code and line number
    ; (Implementation depends on your environment)
    HALT                   ; Stop execution after reporting error
    RET                    ; Return from error routine

; Header Check
CHECK_HEADER:
    CMP R1, EXPECTED_HEADER
    JNE ERROR_HEADER_MISSING

    ; Other header checks...
    JMP CONTINUE_PROGRAM

ERROR_HEADER_MISSING:
    MOV R95, ERR_HEADER_MISSING  ; Set error code for missing header
    JMP REPORT_ERROR             ; Report error

; Block Order Check
CHECK_BLOCK_ORDER:
    CMP R2, EXPECTED_BLOCK       ; Compare current block with expected block
    JNE ERROR_BLOCK_ORDER

    ; Continue with further checks...
    JMP NEXT_BLOCK

ERROR_BLOCK_ORDER:
    MOV R95, ERR_BLOCK_ORDER     ; Set error code for block order error
    JMP REPORT_ERROR             ; Report error

; Command Parsing
PARSE_COMMAND:
    ; Parse the command...
    CMP R0, KNOWN_COMMAND
    JEQ VALID_COMMAND

    ; If the command is not recognized
    MOV R95, ERR_UNRECOGNIZED
    JMP REPORT_ERROR

VALID_COMMAND:
    ; Continue processing the valid command...
    RET

; Data Type Checking (Example in Arithmetic)
CHECK_TYPES:
    CMP TYPE[R1], TYPE[R2]       ; Compare types of operands
    JEQ VALID_TYPES

    ; If types do not match, report error
    MOV R95, ERR_TYPE_MISMATCH
    JMP REPORT_ERROR

VALID_TYPES:
    ; Continue with arithmetic operation...
    RET

; Runtime Error Check (Example in Division)
DIVISION_CHECK:
    CMP R2, 0                    ; Check if divisor is zero
    JNE VALID_DIVISION

    ; If divisor is zero, report runtime error
    MOV R95, ERR_RUNTIME
    JMP REPORT_ERROR

VALID_DIVISION:
    ; Continue with division operation...
    RET

; Main Execution Loop
MAIN_EXECUTION:
    READ R0, R3                  ; Read the current line into R0
    ADD R94, 1                   ; Increment line number after reading a line
    CALL PARSE_COMMAND           ; Parse the command and handle errors

    ; Continue main execution...
    JMP MAIN_LOOP

PROGRAM_END:
    ; End of program
    HALT
```

4. Where to Place Error Checks:
At the Beginning of Each Block: Check for block order and existence.
After Reading Each Line: Check for recognized commands and valid syntax.
Before Each Operation: Verify data types and runtime conditions (e.g., non-zero divisors for division).
After Parsing Each Command: Ensure the command is executable and all arguments are valid.

5. Adding More Context to Errors:
Line Number: R94 tracks the current line number. Update this after every READ operation to ensure accuracy.
Error Codes: Use R95 to store the current error code before jumping to REPORT_ERROR.

6. Extending Error Reporting:
Add more error codes and messages for different types of errors (e.g., syntax errors, undefined variables).
Implement a logging mechanism if your environment allows, to store errors in a log file instead of just halting execution.

By implementing these enhancements, your interpreter will provide more informative feedback, making debugging easier and improving the overall user experience.
