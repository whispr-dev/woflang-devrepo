fren, how do i turn this:
asm
DD_ROUTINE:
   ; Assuming R1 and R2 hold the operands, and R3 is the result register
   ; Check if R1 is an integer or float
   CMP TYPE[R1], INTEGER
   JEQ ADD_INTEGER
   CMP TYPE[R1], FLOAT
   JEQ ADD_FLOAT
   CMP TYPE[R1], STRING
   JEQ ERROR_TYPE_MISMATCH
   ; Other type checks as needed...
DD_INTEGER:
   ; Check if R2 is also an integer
   CMP TYPE[R2], INTEGER
   JNE ERROR_TYPE_MISMATCH
   ADD R3, R1, R2 ; Perform integer addition
   MOV TYPE[R3], INTEGER ; Set the result type to integer
   JMP MAIN_EXECUTION ; Continue
DD_FLOAT:
   ; Convert R1 and R2 to float if necessary
   ; Then perform the float addition
   FADD R3, R1, R2 ; Floating-point addition
   MOV TYPE[R3], FLOAT ; Set result type to float
   JMP MAIN_EXECUTION ; Continue
RROR_TYPE_MISMATCH:
   ; Handle type mismatch error

into something wth the capabilities of this:
python
def parse_tokens(command):
    # Improved regex to match floating-point numbers correctly and other tokens
    pattern = r"[-+]?\d*\.\d+|\b\d+\b|\b\w+_\w+\b|\b\w+\b|[齊隶丶丿而或⊕无无‍而无‍或()門]"
    return [token for token in re.findall(pattern, command) if token.strip()]

please?

To transform your assembly code snippet into something akin to the Python function parse_tokens, we need to enhance the assembly code to:

Parse and Identify Tokens: Like the Python regex function, the assembly code must recognize different types of data (integers, floats, strings, etc.).
Classify Tokens: Just as the Python function does, the assembly needs to determine what each token represents (integer, float, command, etc.).
Handle Mixed Types: The assembly code should be able to parse mixed expressions (e.g., 123 + 4.56 - abc).
Since assembly language is low-level and doesn't directly support regular expressions like Python, you'll need to break down the process into smaller steps:

Steps to Translate parse_tokens Logic to Assembly
Read the Input Command: Use assembly instructions to read the input command.
Character Classification: Identify each character in the command to determine if it's part of a number, letter, or special symbol.
Token Parsing: Construct tokens by grouping characters based on their classification.
Type Determination: Determine the type of each token (integer, float, command, etc.).
Here’s an approach to implement a simplified token parser in assembly, using basic string manipulation and checking instructions.

Assembly Code for Token Parsing
asm
Copy code
; Initialize Registers
MOV R0, 0       ; R0: Pointer to current character in the command
MOV R1, 0       ; R1: Start position of the current token
MOV R2, 0       ; R2: Current token length
MOV R3, MEM[100]; R3: Start address of the command string in memory
MOV R4, 0       ; R4: Register to hold the current character
MOV R5, 0       ; R5: Register to hold the current token type (INTEGER, FLOAT, STRING, etc.)
MOV R6, 0       ; R6: Temporary register

; Pattern Identifiers (Types)
INTEGER EQU 1
FLOAT EQU 2
STRING EQU 3
COMMAND EQU 4
SYMBOL EQU 5

; Token Parsing Loop
PARSE_LOOP:
    LOAD R4, [R3 + R0]     ; Load the current character
    CMP R4, 0              ; Check for end of string (null terminator)
    JE PARSE_END           ; If end of string, end parsing

    ; Check if the character is a digit
    CMP R4, '0'
    JL NOT_DIGIT
    CMP R4, '9'
    JG NOT_DIGIT
    ; It's a digit
    MOV R5, INTEGER        ; Set token type to INTEGER if it hasn't been set
    ADD R2, 1              ; Increment token length
    JMP NEXT_CHAR

NOT_DIGIT:
    ; Check if the character is a dot (.)
    CMP R4, '.'
    JE IS_FLOAT
    ; Check if the character is a letter
    CMP R4, 'A'
    JL NOT_LETTER
    CMP R4, 'Z'
    JG CHECK_LOWERCASE
    ; It's an uppercase letter
    MOV R5, STRING
    ADD R2, 1
    JMP NEXT_CHAR

CHECK_LOWERCASE:
    CMP R4, 'a'
    JL NOT_LETTER
    CMP R4, 'z'
    JG NOT_LETTER
    ; It's a lowercase letter
    MOV R5, STRING
    ADD R2, 1
    JMP NEXT_CHAR

NOT_LETTER:
    ; Check if the character is a command symbol
    CMP R4, '門'
    JE IS_COMMAND
    CMP R4, '('
    JE IS_SYMBOL
    ; Add more checks for symbols if needed

IS_FLOAT:
    MOV R5, FLOAT          ; Set token type to FLOAT if a dot is found
    ADD R2, 1              ; Increment token length
    JMP NEXT_CHAR

IS_COMMAND:
    MOV R5, COMMAND        ; Set token type to COMMAND
    ADD R2, 1              ; Increment token length
    JMP NEXT_CHAR

IS_SYMBOL:
    MOV R5, SYMBOL         ; Set token type to SYMBOL
    ADD R2, 1              ; Increment token length
    JMP NEXT_CHAR

NEXT_CHAR:
    ADD R0, 1              ; Move to the next character
    JMP PARSE_LOOP         ; Continue parsing

PARSE_END:
    ; Parsing is complete, handle the final token
    ; Save or process the token based on type in R5

    ; Reset R1, R2, R5 for next token
    MOV R1, R0             ; Set start position for the next token
    MOV R2, 0              ; Reset token length
    MOV R5, 0              ; Reset token type
    ; Continue to the next part of your program or loop back if processing more input
    JMP NEXT_COMMAND       ; Jump to handle the next command or end

NEXT_COMMAND:
    ; Handle the next command or complete program logic
    HALT                   ; Stop execution for this example
Explanation
Character Reading: The PARSE_LOOP reads each character of the input command one by one using a pointer (R3 + R0).
Classification by Character: It checks if the character is a digit, letter, symbol, or special character. This part of the code emulates the behavior of Python's regex by manually checking character ranges and specific symbols.
Token Type Identification: Sets the token type based on the character type:
Digits ('0'-'9'): Token type is set to INTEGER.
Dot ('.'): Changes the token type to FLOAT.
Letters ('A'-'Z', 'a'-'z'): Token type is set to STRING.
Command Symbols ('門', '()'): Token type is set to COMMAND or SYMBOL.
Token Length Tracking: R2 keeps track of the length of the current token being parsed.
End of String Check: If a null terminator (0) is found, parsing ends.
Handling Mixed and Complex Expressions
To handle mixed and complex expressions:

Store tokens as they are parsed and classify them based on their type.
Build a command execution routine that can handle operations based on the token type.
Use stack-based or register-based evaluation for complex expressions.
Conclusion
This assembly implementation emulates the functionality of Python's parse_tokens using basic string operations and checks. It can handle multiple types of input and lays the groundwork for a more complex interpreter that supports various types and expressions. Further enhancements, such as better error checking and support for additional types, can build upon this foundation.
