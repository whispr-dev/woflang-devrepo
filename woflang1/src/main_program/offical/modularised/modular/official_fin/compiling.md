**how would i go about compiling my interpreter so i can test it out?**

To compile and run your Woflang interpreter written in assembly, you will need to follow several steps. Here's a guide to help you through the process:

Step-by-Step Guide to Compile and Test Your Interpreter

1. Set Up Your Environment
To compile and run assembly code, you'll need an assembler and a linker. For x86_64 assembly on Linux, the most common tools are:

- NASM (Netwide Assembler): An assembler to convert assembly code into object files.
- LD (GNU Linker): A linker to convert object files into executable files.
Installation: Ensure you have NASM and LD installed on your system. You can install them using the following commands on Linux:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nasm
sudo apt install build-essential  # This package includes the GNU linker (ld)
```

2. Organize Your Files
Organize your assembly files and neural net program in a directory structure like this:

```lua
/woflang_interpreter
|-- main64.asm
|-- str64.asm
|-- lgc64.asm
|-- mth64.asm
|-- err64.asm
|-- woflang_symbl_-3-_modul64.asm
|-- woflang_classic_neural_net.txt
```

3. Compile Each Assembly File
You need to compile each of your assembly files into an object file. Run the following commands in your terminal for each .asm file:

```bash
nasm -f elf64 -o main64.o main64.asm
nasm -f elf64 -o str64.o str64.asm
nasm -f elf64 -o lgc64.o lgc64.asm
nasm -f elf64 -o mth64.o mth64.asm
nasm -f elf64 -o err64.o err64.asm
nasm -f elf64 -o woflang_symbl_-3-_modul64.o woflang_symbl_-3-_modul64.asm
```

This command tells NASM to:

`-f elf64:` Generate 64-bit object files.
`-o <output-file>:` Specify the name of the output object file.


4. Link Object Files Into an Executable
After compiling all the files, you need to link them into a single executable file:

```bash
ld -o woflang_interpreter main64.o str64.o lgc64.o mth64.o err64.o woflang_symbl_-3-_modul64.o
```

This command will create an executable named woflang_interpreter.

5. Prepare the Neural Net Program
Ensure that your woflang_classic_neural_net.txt file is properly formatted and available in the same directory as your compiled interpreter. This file will be the input to your interpreter.

6. Run Your Interpreter
Now you can run your interpreter with the neural net program as input. Since your interpreter is likely designed to read from standard input or a file, you can run it with the input file:

```bash
./woflang_interpreter < woflang_classic_neural_net.txt
```

Or, if your interpreter expects a filename as an argument:

```bash
./woflang_interpreter woflang_classic_neural_net.txt
```

7. Debugging and Testing
If you encounter errors or unexpected behavior, you may need to debug your assembly code. Some tips:

Use a debugger: Tools like gdb (GNU Debugger) can help you step through your assembly code.
Add print statements: You can insert assembly instructions to print registers or memory values to understand what your code is doing at each step.

```assembly
section .data
    debug_msg db "Debug info: rax = ", 0

section .text
    ; Example debug print
    mov rax, 1          ; syscall: write
    mov rdi, 1          ; file descriptor: stdout
    mov rsi, debug_msg  ; message to print
    mov rdx, 14         ; message length
    syscall
```

Check for errors: Ensure your interpreter properly handles all possible errors and edge cases. Check the outputs against expected results.

Summary
By following these steps, you can compile your interpreter and run your neural net program on it. If you run into any specific issues during compilation or execution, feel free to ask for more detailed help.
