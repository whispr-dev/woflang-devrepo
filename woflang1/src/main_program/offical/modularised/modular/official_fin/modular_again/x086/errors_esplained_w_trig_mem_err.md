**Great job expanding your error handling module! It looks like you've covered a comprehensive range of error types with well-defined error codes. Let's walk through the final steps to ensure everything is properly integrated and ready for use in your application.**

Final Steps to Integrate Error Handling
Error Reporting: You already have a REPORT_ERROR function that uses Linux syscalls to write error messages to the console and then exit. This function is correctly set up to handle errors by referring to the error code stored in error_code.
Memory and Stack Management: Make sure each function handling errors saves and restores any registers it uses if they need to be preserved across calls. This ensures that your program state is maintained correctly.
Test Cases: Write some test cases for each error type to ensure that your error handling logic works as expected. This involves deliberately causing each error condition and verifying the output.
Example Error Handling Routine Integration
Here is a brief review to ensure all parts are correctly integrated into your error handling module:

Error Codes and Descriptions:
You've defined various error codes (ERR_ constants) for different error types. These constants should correspond to specific error conditions within your application.

Error Routines:
Each error routine (socket_error, bind_error, etc.) sets an appropriate error code in error_code and calls REPORT_ERROR. This consistency is good practice.

Runtime Error Handling:
Your runtime error handler (ADD_RUNTIME_ERR_ROUTINE) checks for runtime-specific errors, such as division by zero and arithmetic overflow. Each specific error condition leads to a distinct error routine, which sets the appropriate error code and reports the error.

Math Error Handling:
ADD_MATH_ERR_ROUTINE handles math-specific errors such as overflow and invalid operands. It performs checks and jumps to specific handlers when errors are detected.

Logic Error Handling:
ADD_LOGIC_ERR_ROUTINE is well-defined for logic errors, such as undefined boolean operations and invalid conditions. It checks for errors and calls REPORT_ERROR when necessary.

String Error Handling:
ADD_STRING_ERR_ROUTINE handles errors related to string operations. It checks for null pointers, string overflow, and invalid operations, with appropriate error codes and reporting.

Memory Command Error Handling:
ADD_MEMCUNRECOG_ERR_ROUTINE manages errors related to unrecognized or invalid memory commands. It checks memory addresses and operations against valid ranges and expected values.

Overloaded Function Error Handling:
ADD_OVLDFUNC_ERR_ROUTINE is a placeholder. You might expand this depending on how overloaded functions are managed in your application.

Sample Assembly Code for Test Cases
To verify the correctness of your error handling, you can write test cases for each error condition. Here's an example of how to trigger a memory error:

```asm
section .text
global _test_memory_error

_test_memory_error:
    ; Simulate invalid memory address access
    mov eax, 0x0           ; Example: setting to an invalid address
    call ADD_MEMCUNRECOG_ERR_ROUTINE
    ret

; Similarly, you can write test routines for other error types:
global _test_division_by_zero

_test_division_by_zero:
    xor ecx, ecx           ; Set divisor to zero
    call ADD_RUNTIME_ERR_ROUTINE
    ret

global _test_math_overflow

_test_math_overflow:
    mov eax, 0x7FFFFFFF    ; Max positive value for signed 32-bit integer
    add eax, 1             ; This causes overflow
    call ADD_MATH_ERR_ROUTINE
    ret
```

Conclusion
You now have a robust and comprehensive error-handling module for your application. Make sure to test each condition thoroughly and adjust the error handling routines as needed to match your specific application logic.
