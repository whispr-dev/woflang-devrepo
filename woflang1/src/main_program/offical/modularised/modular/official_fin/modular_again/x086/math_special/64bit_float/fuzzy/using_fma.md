**fren, can you show me how to use fma and reordering to optimize flops?**


**ChatGPT** _said:_

Certainly! Using Fused Multiply-Add (FMA) instructions and reordering operations are excellent strategies to optimize floating-point operations (FLOPs) in assembly language, especially in computation-heavy tasks like fuzzy logic or numerical algorithms.

What is FMA?
Fused Multiply-Add (FMA) is an instruction that performs a multiplication and an addition in a single step:

FMA:¬†result = (ùëé√óùëè)+ùëê

This operation is performed in one instruction, which is more efficient than performing a multiplication followed by an addition separately. FMA also reduces rounding errors because it computes the result with a single rounding step.

Benefits of Using FMA
- Increased Performance: Reduces the number of instructions and, consequently, the cycles needed for an operation.
- Reduced Rounding Errors: Since FMA performs multiplication and addition in one step, there is only one rounding operation, which minimizes rounding errors.
- Reordering Operations
Reordering operations involves rearranging computations to maximize data reuse, reduce dependency chains, or group operations for better instruction-level parallelism.

Applying FMA and Reordering to Optimize Your Code
Let's look at some examples of how you can use FMA and reordering to optimize your fuzzy logic assembly code.

Example 1: Basic FMA Usage
Original Code (Without FMA):

```assembly
mulsd xmm0, xmm1     ; xmm0 = xmm0 * xmm1
addsd xmm0, xmm2     ; xmm0 = xmm0 + xmm2
```

Optimized Code Using FMA:

```assembly
vfmadd231sd xmm0, xmm1, xmm2 ; xmm0 = (xmm0 * xmm1) + xmm2
Explanation of FMA Instructions
vfmadd231sd xmm0, xmm1, xmm2: This instruction performs the fused multiply-add operation:
xmm0 = (xmm0√óxmm1)+xmm2

The 231 in the instruction name indicates the order of the operands. The numbers refer to the order in which the registers are used for multiplication and addition.

Example 2: Optimizing a Fuzzy Logic Calculation
Let's say you have a fuzzy logic calculation that uses a lot of multiplications and additions.

Original Code:

```assembly
movsd xmm0, [rsi]    ; Load A
movsd xmm1, [rdi]    ; Load B
movsd xmm2, [rdx]    ; Load C
movsd xmm3, [rbx]    ; Load D

mulsd xmm0, xmm1     ; xmm0 = A * B
addsd xmm0, xmm2     ; xmm0 = (A * B) + C
mulsd xmm0, xmm3     ; xmm0 = ((A * B) + C) * D
```

Optimized Code Using FMA and Reordering:

```assembly
movsd xmm0, [rsi]    ; Load A
movsd xmm1, [rdi]    ; Load B
movsd xmm2, [rdx]    ; Load C
movsd xmm3, [rbx]    ; Load D

; Use FMA to combine multiply and add, and reorder to maximize FMA usage
vfmadd231sd xmm0, xmm1, xmm2  ; xmm0 = (A * B) + C
mulsd xmm0, xmm3              ; xmm0 = ((A * B) + C) * D
```

Here, we reordered the operations to use the FMA instruction first, combining the multiplication and addition into one step. Then, we performed the remaining multiplication.

Example 3: Fuzzy Logic Equation Optimization
Consider a more complex fuzzy logic equation that needs optimization.

Original Code:

```assembly
movsd xmm0, [rsi]     ; Load A
movsd xmm1, [rdi]     ; Load B
movsd xmm2, [rdx]     ; Load C
movsd xmm3, [rbx]     ; Load D

; Compute: result = (A * B) + (C * D)
mulsd xmm0, xmm1      ; xmm0 = A * B
mulsd xmm2, xmm3      ; xmm2 = C * D
addsd xmm0, xmm2      ; xmm0 = (A * B) + (C * D)
```

Optimized Code Using FMA and Reordering:

```assembly
movsd xmm0, [rsi]     ; Load A
movsd xmm1, [rdi]     ; Load B
movsd xmm2, [rdx]     ; Load C
movsd xmm3, [rbx]     ; Load D

; Use two FMA instructions to combine operations
vmulsd xmm4, xmm0, xmm1       ; xmm4 = A * B
vfmadd231sd xmm2, xmm3, xmm4  ; xmm2 = (C * D) + (A * B)
movapd xmm0, xmm2             ; Move the result to xmm0 for final output
```

Explanation
- Load Values Efficiently: We load all required values into registers at the beginning to minimize memory accesses.
- Use FMA Instructions: vmulsd and vfmadd231sd are used to perform the multiplication and addition steps in fewer instructions. This approach uses two FMA instructions to handle the calculation (C * D) + (A * B).
- Reordering Operations: Reordering operations to maximize the usage of FMA instructions reduces the number of separate multiply and add instructions.
- Guidelines for Effective FMA and Reordering Optimization
- Identify Independent Operations: Look for parts of your calculations where you can use FMA instructions to combine multiply and add operations.

Minimize Intermediate Stores: Keep as much computation as possible in registers to avoid intermediate stores to memory, which are slower.
Balance FMA Usage: Use FMA to reduce the number of instructions, but don't force reordering if it complicates the logic or reduces readability.
Consider Hardware Capabilities: Ensure the target CPU supports FMA instructions (e.g., Intel Haswell and newer, AMD Bulldozer and newer).
Profile and Measure: Use profiling tools to measure the performance impact of your optimizations and adjust accordingly.

Conclusion
Using FMA instructions and reordering operations can significantly reduce the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) and improve the performance of your fuzzy logic system. By carefully analyzing and optimizing your assembly code, you can make the most of the CPU's capabilities and achieve better efficiency.
