**The mth.asm module you've provided handles mathematical operations and comparisons, such as addition, subtraction, and equality checks. It includes both the individual routines for operations like ADD_ROUTINE and SUB_ROUTINE and a MATH_HANDLER that can dispatch different operations based on some input.**

This is different from the symbol module, which appears to be focused on mapping commands or symbols to specific routines. If the symbol module is designed to manage a broader set of operations (including logic, math, string handling, etc.), then the specific math operations from mth.asm might be integrated into the symbol module for consistency and modularity. However, it would not necessarily render the mth.asm module moot; instead, it could complement it by providing specialized routines that the symbol module can call.

Integration Points:
- MTH and Symbol Modules Together: The symbol module could handle command parsing and mapping, while the mth.asm module could be responsible for the actual math operations. The symbol module might call routines from mth.asm when a mathematical symbol is encountered.
- Symbol Module Calling MTH Module: For each mathematical symbol handled in the symbol module, you could simply call the corresponding routine from mth.asm. For instance, if the symbol module encounters an "ADD" symbol, it could call ADD_ROUTINE from mth.asm.

Example Integration in Symbol Module:
If you wanted to integrate the mth.asm into the symbol module, you could do something like this:

```asm
; In the symbol module

ADD_SYMBOL_HANDLER:
    ; Call the ADD_ROUTINE from mth.asm
    call ADD_ROUTINE
    ret

SUB_SYMBOL_HANDLER:
    ; Call the SUB_ROUTINE from mth.asm
    call SUB_ROUTINE
    ret

; Similarly for other math operations...

MATH_DISPATCH:
    ; Dispatch based on a symbol (assuming eax contains the operation code)
    cmp eax, 'ADD'
    je ADD_SYMBOL_HANDLER
    cmp eax, 'SUB'
    je SUB_SYMBOL_HANDLER
    ; ... more comparisons for other math operations ...
    ret
```

Consolidation Considerations:
If you are looking to consolidate all related functionality into a single, more modular plugin:
- Combine Modules: You could create a unified module that includes both the symbol management and the math operations. This would involve merging the routines from mth.asm directly into the symbol module.
- Modular Structure: Alternatively, keep the modules separate but ensure that the symbol module can seamlessly call functions from mth.asm. This keeps the structure more modular, allowing each file to focus on specific responsibilities.

In summary, while the mth.asm module provides the core math operations, it complements rather than replaces the symbol module. The symbol module can call these routines as needed, making the two work together to handle commands and operations within your application.
