**To translate the pseudocode into Woflang based on the provided key, we need to follow the operations and language constructs. Here’s how we can translate each part of the pseudocode into Woflang:**

Pseudocode Explanation and Woflang Conversion:

- Initial State Configuration:
initial_state: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Woflang equivalent: We will use 門 to assign initial values to an array or individual variables.

- Rule Configuration:
rule: 124
Woflang equivalent: Store this value in a variable.

- Rows Configuration:
rows: 100
Woflang equivalent: Similarly, store this value in a variable.

- Operations (Arithmetic and Logic):
The provided operations in the Woflang key need to be mapped accordingly for operations such as XOR (⊕), AND (而), OR (或), etc.

- Converting the Pseudocode to Woflang:
Given the pseudocode and the Woflang key, here is the translated version:

```wfl
i_1 門 0
i_2 門 0
i_3 門 0
i_4 門 0
i_5 門 0
i_6 門 0
i_7 門 0
i_8 門 0
i_9 門 1
i_10 門 0
i_11 門 0
i_12 門 0
i_13 門 0
i_14 門 0
i_15 門 0
i_16 門 0
i_17 門 0
i_18 門 0
i_19 門 0
i_20 門 0

# Set rule for CA (Cellular Automaton)
rule 門 124

# Set the number of rows to display
num_rows 門 100

# Begin CA processing loop (example, might vary based on implementation)
loop_count 門 0  # Initialize loop counter
num_cells 門 20  # Number of cells in the initial state

# Loop over each row
若 loop_count 小 num_rows 则
    若 loop_count 大 0 则
        # Process the next state using rule 124
        下一行 門 0  # Initialize next row variable (This should represent the CA logic as per the rules)
        若 i_2 ⊕ i_4 则 下一行 齊 1 另 下一行 齊 0  # Example: Rule application (XOR operation using ⊕)
        # Continue for other cells and rules...

        # Increment loop counter
        loop_count 齊 1  # Increment counter by 1

        # Update the state for the next loop (to be detailed for all cells)
        i_1 門 下一行
        # Continue updating for other cells...
    另
        # Handle else case if needed
        结束  # Placeholder for loop end
```

Explanation of Conversion:
- Initial State: Each cell is initialized with a gate operation (門). This initializes each cell as specified in the initial state.
- Rule Configuration: Assign the CA rule value to the variable rule.
- Rows Configuration: Set the total number of rows for the CA simulation.
- Looping Structure: The 若 (if) and 则 (then) statements create a loop to process each step of the CA. The actual logic for rule 124 must be implemented- according to its binary representation, applying XOR (⊕), AND (而), OR (或), etc., to the cells.

Note: The exact implementation details, such as processing each CA step, will depend on how Woflang manages arrays and iteration. The code snippet here gives a structural conversion rather than a full functional one, as the full CA rules might need more specific logic based on the Woflang syntax.
