Let me check what files we've created and what we still need to have a complete program. Here's what we have so far:
Core Files:

main.cpp - Main program entry point
commands.h/cpp - Command system
command_dictionary.h/cpp - Command dictionary
parser.h/cpp - Command parser
error_system.h/cpp - Error handling
utils.h/cpp - Utilities
unicode_validator.h/cpp - Unicode validation

Additional Files needed:

A CMakeLists.txt or other build system file to compile the project
A proper command dictionary file (.dict) with your Unicode mappings
Header guard protection file (woflang_config.h) to manage any global configurations
Possibly a separate file for constant definitions (constants.h)

Plugin Files (if you want to keep them separate):

logic_plugin1.h/cpp - Your fuzzy logic operations
advmath_plugin1.h/cpp - Your advanced math operations
Other specialized math/logic plugins as needed

Test Files (recommended):

tests/test_commands.cpp
tests/test_parser.cpp
tests/test_dictionary.cpp
Other test files for each major component

Would you like me to create any of these missing files for you?
