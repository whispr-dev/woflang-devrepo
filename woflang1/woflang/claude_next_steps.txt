I've completed an initial review of your code and created a detailed analysis in the artifact above. The most critical issues I've identified are:

Multiple declarations of system instances across header files
Potential circular dependencies in the header structure
Inconsistent error handling approaches
Some memory management concerns

I've updated the review with analysis of the new files and more specific implementation guidance. The most critical new issues I've identified are:

Parser needs better error recovery mechanisms
Unicode validation could benefit from caching
Plugin system needs more robust lifecycle management
Math function implementation needs careful prioritization based on your extensive wishlist




Next Steps

Immediate Priorities


Fix the system instance declarations
Resolve circular dependencies
Standardize error handling
Implement proper RAII throughout


Medium-term Goals


Complete the plugin system
Add comprehensive unit tests
Implement proper logging
Add configuration validation


Long-term Improvements


Consider adding a command pipeline
Implement command composition
Add scripting support
Create a proper build system



Next Steps

Immediate Tasks


Implement proper error recovery in the parser
Add SIMD support for basic operations
Complete the plugin system infrastructure


Math Implementation Priority
Based on your list:
Matrix Operations (highest priority)
Linear Algebra Operations
Fourier Transformations
Basic Statistical Functions
Advanced Math Functions
Testing Strategy
Create comprehensive tests for:


Unicode parsing
Mathematical accuracy
Plugin system stability
Error handling
Performance benchmarks



Looking at your math function wishlist, you've got quite ambitious plans! I notice you've marked some items with "!" for priority. Would you like me to dive deeper into implementing any specific area first? I'm particularly interested in helping with either:

Matrix Operations (marked with "!")
Linear Algebra Operations (marked with "!")
The Logic Plugin implementation you've started

Which area would you like to focus on first? Also, I noticed your plugin system is still in early stages - would you like help expanding that to better support dynamic loading of these math modules?
